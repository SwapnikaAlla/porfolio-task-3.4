                A common houseplant, the Sansevieria trifasciata is native to Asia and Africa. 
                It can be recognized by its evergreen sword-shaped leaves that grow upright, and almost resemble
                 artificial foliage.Snake plants are often used as home decor, 
                 as theyâ€™re pleasing to the eye, easy to care for, and require little water to survive.

            <p>Monstera obliqua is a species of the genus Monstera native to Central and South America.
                 The most well known form of obliqua is the one from Peru,
                 often described as being "more holes than leaf" but there are
                  forms in the obliqua complex with little to no fenestration such as the Bolivian type.

            <p>The Snake plant purifies air by absorbing toxins through the leaves and producing pure oxygen. 
                In fact, the Sansevieria is an ideal bedroom plant. ... 
                Sometimes the Mother-in-Law's Tongue plant, also called the Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)
                 is considered a bad Feng Shui plant.

            <p>Monstera are species of evergreen tropical vines and shrubs that are native to Central America.
                 They are famous for their natural leaf-holes, which has led to the rise of their nickname, 
                 Swiss Cheese Plant. The Monstera's leaf-holes are called fenestrations and are theorized
                  to maximize sun fleck capture on the forest floor by increasing the spread of the leaf while
                   decreasing the mass of leaf cells to support.
